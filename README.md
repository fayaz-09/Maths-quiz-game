# Maths-quiz-game
Quiz created using python for an a-level project

The quiz game allows players to create an account which is then added to an sql database. Once logged in players can answer questions on multiple topics, view a leaderboard and get feedback based on the percentage of correct answers in each topic. The questions are simple ones for proff of concept but they can be changed by editing the database add file.

Steps to run:
1. Run database_build2
2. Run database_add2
3. Run tkinterv4 which is the main program to play the quiz.
4. Read_database can be used to view the current contents of the sql database.
